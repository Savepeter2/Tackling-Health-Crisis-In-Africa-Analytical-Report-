# Tackling Health Crisis In Africa [An Analytical Report]

I decided to present a solution on a hackathon organized earlier this year by 10Alytics, a data and strategy company, and the hackathon was focused on the theme “Tackling the health crisis in Africa”. My contribution to the project involved conducting a comprehensive analysis to derive insights and findings on the factors affecting the health crisis in Africa. The aim was to provide the right solutions and recommendations to address the crisis.
